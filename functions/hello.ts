 * Written as a raw FetchableFunction rather than via declareFunction() so the
 * fixture needs no dependency installed. That matters for the static app (which
 * has no package.json at all) and keeps all three fixtures identical, so a
 * failure points at the pipeline rather than at one app's node_modules.
